The dataset used for this task was the BCCD Dataset (link: https://github.com/Shenggan/BCCD_Dataset); a small-scale dataset for blood cells detection. I used this dataset because it involves detecting three distinct classes—Red Blood Cells (RBC), White Blood Cells (WBC), 
and Platelets—within complex biological images.

Run the app.py by using this command in the terminal: uvicorn app:app --reload

For the training side of the code, use this command: python3 train.py

The model weights for both the baseline and stronger models can be downloaded from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MtRWg51N63TUpoikbGJz6WUtghTNbcuU?usp=sharing

Note: steps for running the model are given in the video link attached here:
